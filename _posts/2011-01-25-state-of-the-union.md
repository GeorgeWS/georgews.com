"None of this will be easy. All of it will take time. And it will be harder, because we will argue about *everything*."

When Obama smiled and gave a short chuckle, just after saying that, something awesome happened. For just a moment, I got this sense that he was just another guy, just chatting with some other people, who only happened to number at a few hundred million. It didn't feel like he was giving a speech, it felt like he was just talking to me, speaking from his own mind, and being as honest as a man could be. He was just another guy: one who knew what he was talking about, and understood how we all felt and what goals we shared. For that one little moment, any and all rhetoric melted away, and I caught a glimpse of the future â€“ where there are no Democrats or Republicans, where there are no Americans, Europeans, Middle-Easterners or Asians; not where there aren't any disagreements or differences, but where there aren't distinctions made upon these bases; and where, all in all, there aren't groups, parties, or races, but rather humans.
