# Awe Moments #

Sitting in my room  
Behind a mask of homework  
I ponder it all  

Biology books  
Pages flip casually  
I see more than them  

Music pulses through  
Green walls and brown shades pulled up  
I can't help but think  

Math swirls through my head  
Earth spinning beneath my feet  
I know they're the same  

Sitting in my room  
Where did reality go  
I don't care one bit  

Tears search for my eyes  
My gaze shifts to the window  
I sense time's rare halt  

Songs play through paused air  
The textbook sits in my lap  
I feel the world turn  

Cat jumps onto me  
Tears finally find their way  
I love the soft purr  

Existence awes me  
Everything is around me  
I cease to worry  

Sitting in my room  
Where did reality go  
I found it right here
